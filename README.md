Fine Tuning Mask-RCNN model to a custom Dataset

Welcome to my **Adaptive Mask R-CNN** project, where cutting-edge techniques are applied to enhance object detection in optical remote sensing imagery. This project focuses on overcoming the unique challenges associated with remote sensing data, including object scale variability, the detection of small objects, and data scarcity.

## **Project Overview**

This repository implements an advanced object detection system based on the **Mask R-CNN** architecture, tailored specifically for optical remote sensing images. By leveraging transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine-tuning, the model achieves robust performance across various remote sensing scenarios.

### **Key Features**

- **Transfer Learning:** Utilizes pre-trained models to improve accuracy and speed up training, especially when dealing with limited data.
- **Data Augmentation:** Employs sophisticated techniques to artificially expand the dataset, improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tunes the model on specific remote sensing datasets to better capture the nuances of the data.

### **Optimization Techniques**

The implementation rigorously explores various optimization methods to maximize model performance, including:
- **Adam:** Adaptive learning rate optimization.
- **SGD:** Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum.
- **RMSprop:** Root Mean Square Propagation for better handling of non-stationary objectives.
- **Adam_SGD:** A hybrid approach combining the strengths of Adam and SGD.

## **Getting Started**
